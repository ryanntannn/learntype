The call for alternative discourses in Asian social sciences suggests that the social sciences take place in a social and historical context, and must be relevant in this context. One way to achieve relevance is to develop original concepts and theories on the bases of the philosophical traditions and popular discourses of these societies. Any claim to universality must respect the extent of the differences between Asian and non-Asian societies, and admit that in some instances distinct theoretical backgrounds are required.

While there may be general agreement on the need for alternative discourses among social scientists in Asian countries, actual proposals remain scarce. Let us for this reason consider some models of alternative theories and concepts in social sciences which have been developed in the Asian context.

The call for alternative discourses in Asian social sciences does not imply any cultural homogeneity in Asia, or that there is anything like an Asian branch of social sciences.

The goal is not to substitute Eurocentrism with another ethnocentrism. But any claim to universality must respect the extent of the differences between Asian and non-Asian societies, and admit that in some instances distinct theoretical backgrounds are required.
